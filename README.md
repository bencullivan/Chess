A real time chess web app for playing chess with your friends!

Click the link associated with this repository in order to visit the site. (I am using free tier hosting, so the initial load time can be slow sometimes.)

Generate a game id and share it with your opponent. Once you both enter it on the home screen you can play chess. 

The tech stack of this application consists of React, Express, Redis, and MongoDB.

Have fun playing chess!
